`vagrant init hashicorp/precise64`

`vagrant up`

After running the above two commands, you will have a fully running virtual machine in VirtualBox running Ubuntu.
You can SSH into this machine with `vagrant ssh`, 
and when you are done playing around, you can terminate the virtual machine with `vagrant destroy`.
